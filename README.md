# dynamic_query
Dynamic sql query example

This example is written on Codeigniter 2.2 and uses the Mysql [employees sample database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/)

If you have trouble importing the sample database structure to a Mysql 5.6.23 database, try importing the employees_structure.sql included in this repository then download the huge sample data from Mysql directly.
